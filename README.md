# pbdR Docker Builds

Docker build configurations for the pbdR package ecosystem.  Builds are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rbigdata/).

Builds are separated into `devel` for reasonably current development versions of the packages, and `release` for the stable release version.

* devel sources: [github.com/rbigdata/](github.com/rbigdata/)
* release sources: [pbdr.org/releases/](pbdr.org/releases/)

For an explanation of which packages are distributed with each build, see the latest release's README (available from the release link above). There is no difference in which packages are distributed between devel and release builds.
